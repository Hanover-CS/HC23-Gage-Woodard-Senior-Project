# Super Gorilla Weightlifting

**Project Idea**

The purpose of this app is for weightlifters to have the ability to choose a weightlifting program 
that best suits their needs and be able to keep track of their progress. I want this app to cater 
to beginner lifters all the way through to advanced lifters. I want to make the app easy to use 
and dependable, so the app does not have glitches or erases any progress from the user. The app will 
allow users to choose the lifting path that they want to follow like powerlifting, CrossFit, 
weight loss, etc. When they choose which path, they will be given monthly workouts for them to 
complete. This is where they will also be able to track their weights for each lift.

**Main Features**

Here are some main features that I would like to include with the creation of my app.

1. Helpful tips on explaining how to perform a lift
2. Weight tracking ability
3. Choose your desired path
4. Entering maxes at beginning
5. Multiple lifting options

The helpful tips will be used to help users maintain and keep good form throughout the entire 
lifting motion. This will be especially helpful to lifters that are just beginning their weight 
training and will lower the chances of them getting hurt during a lift. This is something that I 
wish I had when I started to lift weights as it would have allowed me to perfect my form easier and 
would have benefited me in the beginning stages.

A feature that almost comes with every lifting app is the ability to track your progress as much 
as you would like. This is one of the best features that can come with any app like this because 
it is nice to look back on previous lifts and see what weight you did for those. From personal 
experience this is the easiest way to make sure that you are making progress towards your goals and
make sure you are doing the correct weight.

At the start of this app, you will get to choose the path you desire. I hope to have different 
options like powerlifting, CrossFit, bulking, cutting and others. This is a unique part of my app 
that many other apps do not have. Other apps tend to cater to just one style of lifting. I want my
app to be used by all lifters no matter their goals.

When you choose the path, you want to take with this app, I want to have the user put in past 
maxes before they are given the program. This will help calculate percentages for weight they 
should be lifting for the different workouts they are given. This will help the workouts be more 
effective and specific for each user.

When I talk about multiple lifting options, I mean by what kind of workouts you do each week. Many 
lifting apps will have the user hit the same style lifts every single week, this becomes very 
boring and repetitive. From personal experience the repetition does not make people want to go to 
the gym and improve their goals, it is always nice to mix things up.


**Similar Solutions**

Here are some similar apps that I have found when researching about weightlifting apps.

1. [PH3 Powerlifting][1]{1}
2. [Alpha Progression App][2]{2}
3. [Strong][3]{3}
4. [Tempo Move][4]{4}

The PH3 Powerlifting app is used by many power lifters that would like to compete in competitions 
or by lifters that are looking to solely get stronger. This app is set for a 13-week lifting cycle 
that gives you specific workouts and goals to gain strength. Therefore, many advance lifters will 
use this app because it is specifically created for them. That is where my app would be different, 
I want my app to be used by all and for the app to have many different lifting options to choose 
from. What I like most about this app is the simplicity behind it and that it barely runs with any 
glitches connected with it. Having a smooth-running app is something I will be shooting for when 
creating my app because that is what users want and I personally would not want my app to glitch 
and erase all my data. This [article][5]{5} talks about a personal perspective of the app and how it 
works.

The Alpha Progression App is and app that allows the user to track their lifting progression 
through a certain period that they choose. This app closely compares to what I would like to do 
with my app in terms of users being able to track their weightlifting progression. I want to be 
able to add spots in this app where lifters can put the weight they do after each set and be able 
to save the data so the user can go back and see what they did previously and have the chance to 
add extra weight if they would like. Something this app has that is different than mine is that the
user can put in different equipment that they have available to them and the A.I. will generate 
workouts according to that based on what they have available. I do not plan to add this in with my 
app because I think the best way to achieve your goal is to get out and do these lifts at gyms.

Strong is another weightlifting app that caters to more advanced lifters. The app allows for people
to keep track of their best sets, max 1RM, body fat percentage and more. The app is like a notebook,
it allows you to make notes about your lifts and what happens with your weight you use. With the 
"notebook" feature users are free to have more custom experience when using the app. This is a 
version of what I would like to do with my app, I would like my app to allow the users to track and
write what they did for each set. The strong app is more open in terms of the lifting experience but
being able to make notes for your lifts and how they went is a unique style that I have seen from 
other lifting apps, and it is something I want to look more into. The [GetGymFit][6]{6} website talks 
about some reviews of this app and what people think more about it.

Tempo Move is a very advanced workout app when it comes to tracking your weight and being able to 
get helpful tips and more ideas from other trainers. This app comes with trackable dumbbells, and 
they are also going to have trackable barbells. The app also has a massive library of on-demand 
and live workouts for the user to use and have access to. Tempo Move uses the camera on your iPhone 
to monitor and track your movements, helping to provide advice and insights on your workouts. I 
have never really seen an app that has built in live workouts that users can follow along with while
the app simultaneously is able to track your dumbbells and barbells to make sure your form is 
correct and that you are doing the correct movements. This app would easily be great for 
inexperienced users and even advanced users because of the built-in tracking that will help people 
become better lifters and would eliminate injuries that could arise. Having trackable dumbbells and 
barbells would benefit my app if I were able to make it that way because it would allow beginners 
or lifters trying to compete track and see how they are moving their lifts and they could plan 
accordingly to improve.

**Relevant Technologies**

This is a list of languages that can be used when programming for mobile applications.

1. [Java][7]{7}
2. [Kotlin][8]{8}
3. [React Native][9]{9}
4. [Flutter][10]{10}
5. [C++][11]{11}

Java was the official language of app development. Many of the apps that are in the Play Store are
built in Java and Java is also the most supported language by Google. Java is an object-oriented and
class-based programming language, OOP is a model that organizes software design around data, or 
objects, rather than functions and logic. Java is one of many different languages that could be used
in terms of App Development considering that there are multiple languages out, it is just the most 
used language at this time.

Kotlin is the other widely used programming language for app development, it is a statically typed 
programming language, and it is completely interoperable with the Java programming language. Some 
differences from Java to Kotlin is that Kotlin removes the superfluous features of Java such as null
pointer exceptions. It also removes the necessity of ending every line with a semicolon. Kotlin is 
also object-oriented programming, but it also has the advantages of functional object-oriented 
programming which is based around representing some parts of code as objects.

React Native is a cross platform coding language that can be used for IOS applications and Android 
applications. React Native is based on JavaScript which is the most popular front-end programming 
language. React Native can use third-party plugins and packages to enhance the capabilities of the 
applications. Also, many open-source JavaScript libraries found on NPM can be used when using React 
Native. React Native does not need a compiler and it lets developers detect and solve errors quickly. 
These are some keys as to why many apps like Facebook and Instagram use React Native.

Flutter is an open-source UI development kit from Google for the development of natively compiled 
applications and is a cross platform coding language that can be used for IOS and Android apps. 
Flutter uses a combined collection of Dart programming language, Flutter engine, and Foundation
library. Flutter allows changes to source code to be reflected onto running applications, without 
losing state or restarting. That is why this engine is being used by companies like Google and BMW. 
Flutter also has access to the Foundation Library which is written in Dart, it provides many 
fundamental functions and classes that are used for building Flutter applications.

C++ is an android native programming language when it comes to building applications. 
The programming language is typically practiced for graphics-heavy applications which explains why 
it would be used by companies like YouTube and Adobe Photoshop. C++ is a structured programming 
language where coders can divide the application into distinct sections according to their roles. 
C++ uses a compiler which are utility programs that take your code and transform it into executable 
machine code files. The compiler contributes to the execution speed of this language compared to 
other languages.
