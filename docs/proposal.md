**Project Idea**

This app will be created with the vision that anybody that wants to lift will be able to use this 
app. I want this app to cater to beginner lifters all the way through to advanced lifters. I hope 
to make the app easy to use and reliable for the users. The app will allow users to choose the 
lifting path that they want to follow like powerlifting, crossfit, weight loss, etc.

**Main Features**

Here are some main features that I would like to include with the creation of my app.

1. Helpful tips on explaining how to perform a lift
2. Weight tracking ability
3. Choose your desired path
4. Entering maxes at beginning
5. Multiple lifting options

The helpful tips will be used to help users maintain and keep good form throughout the entire 
lifting motion. This will be especially helpful to lifters that are just beginning their weight 
training and will lower the chances of them getting hurt during a lift. This is something that I 
wish I had when I started to lift weights as it would have allowed me to perfect my form easier 
and would have benefited me in the beginning stages.

A feature that almost comes with every lifting app is the ability to track your progress as much 
as you would like. This is one of the best features that can come with any app like this because 
it is nice to look back on previous lifts and see what weight you did for those. From personal 
experience this is the easiest way to make sure that you are making progress towards your goals 
and make sure you are doing the correct weight.

At the start of this app you will get to choose the path you desire. I hope to have different 
options like powerlifting, crossfit, bulking, cutting and others. This is a unique part of my 
app that many other apps do not have. Other apps tend to cater to just one style of lifting. 
I want my app to be used by all lifters no matter their goals.

When you choose the path you want to take with this ap, I also want to have the user put in past 
maxes before they are given the program. This will help calculate percentages for weight they 
should be lifting for the different workouts they are given. This will help the workout be more 
effective and specific for each user.

When I talk about multiple lifting options I mean by what kind of workouts you do each week. 
Many lifting apps will have the user hit the same style lifts every single week, this becomes very 
boring and repetitive. From personal experience the repetition does not make people want to go to 
the gym and improve their goals, it is always nice to mix things up.

**Similar Solutions**

Here are some similar apps that I have found when researching about weightlifting apps.

1. [PH3 Powerlifting][1]
2. [Alpha Progression App][2]
3. [Strong][3]
4. [Tempo Move][4]

The PH3 Powerlifting app is used by many power lifters that would like to compete in competitions 
or by lifters that are looking to solely get stronger. This app is set for a 13 week lifting cycle 
that gives you specific workouts and goals to gain strength. This is why many advance lifters will
use this app because it is specifically created for them. That is where my app would be different, 
I want my app to be used by all and for the app to have many different lifting options to choose
from. What I like most about this app is the simplicity behind it and that it barely runs with any 
glitches connected with it. Having a smooth running app is something I will be shooting for when
creating my app because I believe that is what users want and I personally would not want my app 
to glitch and erase all my data. This [article][5] talks about a personal perspective of the app 
and how it works.

The Alpha Progression App is and app that allows the user to track their lifting progression 
through a certain time period that they choose. This app closely compares to what I would like to 
do with my app in terms of users being able to track their weightlifting progression. I want to be 
able to add spots in this app where lifters can put the weight they do after each set and be able 
to save the data so the user can go back and see what they did previously and have the chance to 
add extra weight if they would like. Something this app has that is really different than mine is 
that the user can put in different equipment that they have available to them and the A.I. will 
generate workouts according to that based on what they have available. I do not plan to add this 
in with my app because I think the best way to achieve your goal is to get out and do these lifts 
at gyms.

Strong is another weightlifting app that caters to more advanced lifters. The app allows for people
to keep track of their best sets, max 1RM, body fat percentage and more. The app is somewhat like a 
notebook, it allows you to make notes about your lifts and what happens with your weight you use. 
With the "notebook" feature users are free to have more custom experience when using the app. 
This is a version of what I would like to do with my app, I would like my app to allow the users to 
track and write what they did for each set. The strong app is more open in terms of the lifting 
experience but being able to make notes for your lifts and how they went is a different style that 
I have seen from other lifting apps and it is something I want to look more into. The 
[GetGymFit][6] website talks about some reviews of this app and what people think more about it.

Tempo Move is a very advanced workout app when it comes to tracking your weight and being able to 
get helpful tips and more ideas from other trainers. This app comes with trackable dumbbells and 
they are also going to have trackable barbells. The app also has a massive library of on-demand 
and live workouts for the user to use and have access to. Tempo Move uses the camera on your iphone 
to monitor and track your movements, helping to provide advice and insights on your workouts. I 
have never really seen an app that has built in live workouts that users can follow along with 
while the app simultaneously is able to track your dumbbells and barbells to make sure your form 
is correct and that you are doing the correct movements. This app would easily be great for new 
users and even advanced users because of the built in tracking that will help people become better 
lifters and would eliminate possible injuries that could arise. Having trackable dumbbells and 
barbells would benefit my app if I was able to make it that way because it would allow beginners 
or lifters trying to compete track and see how they are moving their lifts and they could plan 
accordingly to improve.
