Super Gorilla Weightlifting 

   This app will be a collection of all different lifting styles to cater to all different types of 
lifters in the community. The app will allow users to choose the lifting path that they want to
follow like powerlifting, crossfit, bulking, etc. Based on what the user chooses the app will 
generate a workout plan for them for each month they choose to use the app. User will be able to 
track their lifting progress and see what recommended weight they should be using for the lifts. 
The app will also gives tips on how to keep correct form during the weight training so beginners 
will be less likely to get hurt. This will allow the app to be used by anyone and everyone that 
choose to become a better version of themselves. 

   Some existing apps that are currently out right now are apps like PH3 Powerlifting. This app is 
set for a 13 week lifting cycle that gives you specific workouts and goals to gain strength. This
is a simple for but very effective and reliable. The app is basic in terms of lifting programs so 
it does not have very many glitches or ways for the app to run slowly. The way the app runs is how 
I want to plan and run my app. I want my app to run smoothly with no glitches so it will be a
reliable source that everyone likes to use. Anther app that is on the market right now is the Alpha 
Progression App. The app uses A.I. to generate workout plans, based on available equipment and 
experience. This is something I would like to look into when it comes to generating workouts for
the app users when they choose the path they desire.
