# Super Gorilla Weightlifting

**Project Idea:**

This app will be created with the vision that anybody that wants to lift will be able to use this 
app. I want this app to cater to beginner lifters all the way through to advanced lifters. I hope 
to make the app easy to use and reliable for the users. The app will allow users to choose the 
lifting path that they want to follow like powerlifting, crossfit, weight loss, etc.

**Main Features:**

When researching other weightlifting apps I came across a feature that was used by one app that I 
really want to include in my app. That is adding helpful tips besides the lift the user is doing at 
that time to help them maintain and keep good form throughout the entire lifting motion. This will 
be especially helpful to lifters that are just beginning their weight training and will lower the 
chances of them getting hurt during a lift. A feature that almost comes with every lifting app is 
the ability to track your progress as much as you would like. This is a feature that I would also 
like to add in with my app, I like the idea that users will be able to track what they do for each 
workout so they would be able to make more progress. I also want to add a feature that at the start 
of the app you choose the path you desire and you also put your max weights for some of the main 
lifts. This will allow the app to show the user what weight they should use during the lifting 
sessions to insure progress. Based on what lifting journey the user uses the app will give them 
monthly workouts they can use for however long they wold like.
