[Alpha Progression App][1] This is a secondary source app review from Fitness Drum. They review 
different lifting apps and explain different features of apps.
1. The Alpha Progression App is and app that allows the user to track their lifting progression 
through a certain time period that they choose. The app uses A.I. to generate workout plans, 
based on available equipment and experience. The app also allows for users to create custom
workout plans and save custom lifts.
2. What I like about this app is that a user is able to create customs workout plans that could 
work better for your own personal goals. The downside to that is if you want to workout for a 
goal and don't know how to program it this app would not work. This apps A.I. is used to generate
more bodybuilding workouts over anything else. I am hoping to create an app that would cater to 
more lifting options. I do like how this app uses A.I. generation in terms of creating workouts for
users based on equipment that they have available. 

[PH3 Powerlifting][2] This is a main source app overview from PH3 PowerLifting. They go into detail
on who the app was designed for and why beginner lifters might not want to use the app.
1. This app is set for a 13 week lifting cycle that gives you specific workouts and goals to gain
strength. Nothing is A.I. generated the workouts are set in stone and use lifting percentages to 
tell the user what weight they should be lifting for a specific exercise. They pride themselves on 
having a super easy app to use and it works for the intended audience.
2. What I like most about this app is that it is simple to use for the user and it is straight 
forward on the lifts that people can use for it. It make sense that the app would already have
straight forward lifting schedules. It is straight to the point and they know how to program for 
the people that they want using the app.

[Strong][3] This is a main source app overview talking about some features the strong app uses.
They talk about some key features that their app has that some other tracking apps do not have. 
1. The app allows for people to keep track of their best sets, max 1RM, body fat percentage and
more. The app is somewhat like a notebook, it allows you to make notes about your lifts and what 
happens with your weight you use. The app also gives you helpful tips and reminders that will 
help you with the lift you are hitting that day. 
2. I like how this app is more free to use and that you would be able to write notes about your
lifts that you hit that day and how you might want to improve on or different things to do better 
the next day. The helpful tips that the app gives use is also something that is very unique. I have 
never seen an app that gives you these tips for form and other things. 

[Tempo Move][4] This is a secondary source app review that talks about features that the app has 
and how the app would be the best for a user to use. 
1. Tempo Move is an app that comes with trackable dumbbells and they are also going to have
trackable barbells. The app also has a massive library of on-demand and live workouts for the user 
to use and have access to. Tempo Move uses the camera on your iphone to monitor and track your 
movements, helping to provide advice and insights on your workouts.
2. Having the app use your camera to monitor and track your movements is a great way for the app
to help improve form and ways to lift better. I really think that is a great addition for this app
to set itself apart from other apps. Another thing that helps the app do this is because they use 
trackable dumbbells and eventually barbells. Not many apps use this and I think this is very useful 
for beginners if you are trying to help new people to get into lifting.
